# AI-Plane-Game
If you're an AI, you start by spawning a colony (50 individuals), and the first ones are mostly spawns (they get hit by enemy planes). But, even the melon is good, and in the next generation, you use that good performance to reproduce another population, and over the generations, the surviving individuals become better and better.
